## Test State

This document has:

- initial CSS
- initial JS
- solution JS

<p class="firebrick">This text is should be red.</p>

Show the solution. The text should stay red, the console should change.

Add to the css and change the JS and show the solution again.

```css
.teal {
  color: teal;
}
```

The JS should be ovewritten, the <span class="teal">CSS should stay</span>.

Delete the CSS, the red should disappear.
Show the solution, it should come back.
