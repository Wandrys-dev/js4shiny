## Plain HTML Document

This R Markdown format creates a plain HTML document with minimal dependencies.
This means that the final document does not contain the typical CSS and JavaScript dependencies that are typically created with the `rmarkdown::html_document()` format.

By default, one dependency is included. [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
provides a set of CSS resets that ensure that the final HTML document renders similarly across all browsers.

If this page looks like a webpage from 1994---and you haven't included any CSS files---then dont' worry, it's working!

## Including CSS and JavaScript

### CSS

To include CSS files in the `<head>` of your HTML,
use the `css` option.

```yaml
output:
  js4shiny::html_document_plain:
    css: "styles.css"
```

or you can use CSS chunks anywhere in your R Markdown document.

````markdown
```{css echo=FALSE}`r ''`
.red {
  color: red;
}
```
````

### JavaScript

To include JavaScript files, use the `script` option.
The `include_script()` helper function will help you format the argument correctly.
You can choose to include `.js` files in the `head` of your HTML document, or immediately `before` or `after` the content in the `<body>` of your HTML.

```{r include-script-demo}
js4shiny::include_script(
  head = "script-in-head.js",
  before = "script-before.js",
  after = c("script-after-1.js", "script-after-2.js")
)
```

You can similarly specify this in YAML format.

```yaml
output:
  js4shiny::html_document_plain:
    script:
      head: script-in-head.js
      before: script-before.js
      after: 
        - script-after-1.js
        - script-after-2.js
```

Finally, you can similarly include JavaScript code anywhere in the body of your R Markdown with a `{js}` chunk.

````markdown
```{js}`r ''`
console.log('hello, world')
```
````
