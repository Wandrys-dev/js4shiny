## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## JavaScript

The `js4shiny::html_document_js()` format enables **literate programming** with JavaScript.
All `console.log()` outputs are evaluated in the browser and returned within the document when viewed,
just like the R code above.

```{js, name="Tagged Template Literals"}
function boldMe(strs, ...vals) {
    let str = strs.map((string, i) => {
        return `${string}${vals[i] ? `<b>${vals[i]}</b>` : ''}`
    })
    return str.join('');
}

const make = 'Porsche'
const model = '718 Cayman'
const sentence = boldMe`My next car is a ${make} ${model}`
console.log(sentence);

console.log(`My next car is a ${make ? `<b>${make}</b>` : ''}`)
```

## JSON

Chunks are color coded according to their type,
with colors defined for `R`, `js`, `json`, `node`, `bash`, `md`, and `yaml`.
You can also use the `name` chunk option to set the name of the chunk,
which should be used when the code shown is intended for a particular file.

```{json, name="topAlbums.json"}
[
  {
      "Artist": "Eagles",
      "Album": "Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975)",
      "Released": 1976,
      "Claimed sales*": 51,
  },
  {
      "Artist": "AC/DC",
      "Album": "Back in Black",
      "Released": 1980,
      "Claimed sales*": 50,
  },
  {
      "Artist": "Pink Floyd",
      "Album": "The Dark Side of the Moon",
      "Released": 1973,
      "Claimed sales*": 45,
  },
]
```

## node, bash, command line

```node
npm run-script build
```

```bash
