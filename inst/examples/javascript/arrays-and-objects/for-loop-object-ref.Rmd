example:
  title: For Loop - Object References
  instructions: |-
    We have **12** apples, **6** bananas, **2** coconuts, and **13** dragon fruit.
    
    We run into a friend who wants to trade us 4 of our apples and all of our coconuts in exchange for 2 more dragon fruit.
    We're intrigued but not convinced and we have temporary amnesia and forget how to do mental math.

    Use the `for ... in` loop and `if ... else` statements to update `fruits`, but first save a copy of your current fruit inventory so you can remember how much you had originally.
  hint: |-
    When you've completed the above example,
    compare the value of `backupFruits` and `fruits`.
    Are the the same or did one of them change?
  runtime: repl_js
  mode:
    document: html
  initial:
    js: |-
      const fruits = { /* ... */ }
      
      let backupFruits = fruits

      for (____ fruit of Object.keys(____)) {
        if (fruit === "apple") {
          ____[fruit] -= 4
        } else if (fruit === ____) {
          ____[fruit] = 0
        } else if (________) {
          // update dragon fruit
        }
      }

      console.log('-- fruits --')
      console.table(fruits)
    css: ~
  solution:
    js: |-
      const fruits = {
        apple: 12,
        banana: 6,
        coconut: 2,
        "dragon fruit": 13
      }
      
      let backupFruits = fruits
      
      for (let fruit of Object.keys(fruits)) {
        if (fruit === "apple") {
         fruits[fruit] -= 4
        } else if (fruit === 'coconut') {
          fruits[fruit] = 0
        } else if (fruit === 'dragon fruit') {
          fruits[fruit] += 2
        }
      }
      
      console.log('-- fruits --')
      console.table(fruits)
      
      // what did we have originally?
      console.log('-- backupFruits --')
      console.table(backupFruits)
