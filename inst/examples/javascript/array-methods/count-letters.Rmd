  title: Count the Number of Letters
  instructions: Loop over the letters in the word `flyby` and store the count of each
    letter in an object.
  hint: |
    `for ... of` loops coerce strings to an array of characters!
    
    Use bracket notation — `obj[keyVar]` — to access the property
    of an object using a string stored in a variable.
