  title: JS Operators - Are we there yet?
  instructions: |-
    We estimate a task will take **4,321** seconds.
    **1,234** seconds have already passed.
    How many _seconds_ are remaining for the task?
    How many _minutes_ and seconds are remaning?

    Write the estimated time in minutes and seconds in a sentence,
    filling in the blanks of the template below.
  hint: >
    Fill in the `____` with the missing JavaScript code. 
    The console log below will show `[SyntaxError]...` until you fix them all.
  runtime: repl_js
  mode:
    document: html
  initial:
    js: |-
      const task = 4321
      const elapsed = 1234

      // Initialize variable with the remaining seconds
      ____ remaining = ____

      // How many seconds left over if you take out the minutes?
      ____ remainingSeconds = ____ % ____

      // Take out those seconds from the remaining total
      remaining = remaining - remainingSeconds

      // Convert remaining seconds to minutes
      ____ remainingMinutes =

      // console.log with object notation: :sunglasses:
      console.log({task, elapsed, remaining, remainingSeconds, remainingMinutes})

      const msg = `${___} minutes, ${_____} seconds left in the task`

      msg
  solution:
    js: |-
      const task = 4321
      const elapsed = 1234
      
      // Initialize variable with the remaining seconds
      let remaining = task - elapsed
      
      // How many seconds left over if you take out the minutes?
      const remainingSeconds = remaining % 60
      
      // Take out those seconds from the remaining total
      remaining = remaining - remainingSeconds
      
      // Convert remaining seconds to minutes
      const remainingMinutes = remaining / 60
      
      // console.log with object notation: :sunglasses:
      console.log({task, elapsed, remaining, remainingSeconds, remainingMinutes})
      
      const msg = `${remainingMinutes} minutes, ${remainingSeconds} seconds left in the task`
      
      msg
output: js4shiny::html_document_js4shiny
