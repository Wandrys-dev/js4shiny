    _Higher-order functions_ are functions can take other functions as arguments.

    Write a higher-order function that uses closures to create a new function that only allows the input function to be called once.
  runtime: repl_js
  initial:
    js: |
      const hello = () => {
        console.log('hello world!')
      }

      const oneTimeOnly = (fn) => {
        // return a function that only lets
        // the input function be called one time
      }

      const oneHello = oneTimeOnly(hello)

      oneHello() // hello world
      oneHello() // won't say hello again
      oneHello() // also won't say hello
  solution:
    js: |
      const hello = () => {
        console.log('hello world!')
      }

      const oneTimeOnly = (fn) => {
        let count = 0;
        return () => {
          if (count === 0) {
            count += 1
            fn()
          } else {
            console.log("That's quite enough, thank you!")
          }
        }
      }

      const oneHello = oneTimeOnly(hello)

      oneHello() // hello world
      oneHello() // won't say hello again
      oneHello() // also won't say hello
