example:
  title: Strings in For Loops
  instructions: |-
    How do each of the three styles of `for` loop work with strings?
    Write a for loop in each style to loop over the string stored in `praise`
    and print the element in the loop to the console.
  hint: |-
    Follow up: what type is the iterator in the `for ... in` loop?
    (Meaning, what type is `x` in `for (const x in ...)`?)
    Add a check to the loop you wrote to confirm or disprove your intuition.
  runtime: repl_js
  initial:
    js: |-
      let praise = 'dazzling!'

      // for ... of

      // for ... in

      // classic for loop
      
  solution:
    js: |-
      let praise = 'dazzling!'

      for (const letter of praise) {
        console.log(letter)
      }

      for (const idx in praise) {
        console.log(idx)
      }

      for (let i = 0; i < praise.length; i++) {
        console.log(`praise[${i}] - ${praise[i]}`)
      }

      for (const idx of praise.substring(0, 1)) {
        console.log(typeof idx)
      }
output: js4shiny::html_document_plain
