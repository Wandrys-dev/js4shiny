pagetitle: Convert Strings to Title Case
example:
  title: Convert Strings to Title Case
  instructions: |-
    Our list of `badHeadlines` also has bad formatting.
    Write a set of nested for loops to transform the headlines to title case.
    The first for loop should loop over the strings in the `badHeadlines` array,
    and the second for loop will loop over the individual letters of each string
  hint: A classic `for` loop may work best in this case.
  runtime: repl_js
  initial:
    js: |-
      let badHeadlines = [
        'COMPLAINTS ABOUT NBA REFEREES GROWING UGLY',
        'shark attacks puzzle experts',
        'Stolen painting found by tree',
        'Lack of Brains Hinders Research'
      ];
      
      for (/* headline from badHeadlines */) {
        for (/* letter in that headline */) {
          // capitalize or lowercase the letter
        }
      }
      
      console.log(badHeadlines)
  solution:
    js: |-
      let badHeadlines = [
        'COMPLAINTS ABOUT NBA REFEREES GROWING UGLY',
        'shark attacks puzzle experts',
        'Stolen painting found by tree',
        'Lack of Brains Hinders Research'
      ];

      for (let i = 0; i < badHeadlines.length; i++) {
        let headline = badHeadlines[i]
        let newHeadline = ''
        for (let j = 0; j < headline.length; j++) {
          if (j === 0 || headline[j - 1] === ' ') {
            newHeadline += headline[j].toUpperCase()
          } else {
            newHeadline += headline[j].toLowerCase()
          }
        }
        badHeadlines[i] = newHeadline
      }

      console.log(badHeadlines)
output: js4shiny::html_document_plain
